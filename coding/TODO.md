# TODO styles

I use below annotations to mark the code as TODO.

# `XXX`

General TODOs. I use it when:

- I feel annoying to use appropriate and more detailed annotation.
- This TODO has relatively low priority.


# `TODO`

TODOs which must be resolved in the future. I use it when:

- This TODO has relatively high priority. In many cases, related Issue would be created.

- This TODO appears with comments which describes the situation in detail.

# `YYY`

TODOs which must be resolved before commiting this change.

I search for this annotation before commit.

If this annotation appears in the GitHub repository, it is mistake in many cases.
